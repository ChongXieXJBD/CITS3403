Project
Stage 2: Backend functionality
The project Stage II is to develop a reactive web application to fill in the functionality of your webpage. This is worth 20% of the total assessment. Stage II is due Monday 11:59pm May 28 Thursday 11:59pm May 31st.

The second stage will combine the best parts of each groups submission for part I and add backend functionality (user authentication, tasks voting, ordering and assignment algorithms, notification services). The web application should be implmented using a MEAN stack, and provide at least the following functionality:

A user account and login feature.
The ability to edit personal details, propose projects, post tasks and specify preferences in the context of a project.
A method to vote, rank and suggest tasks.
Bonus marks will be available for the following types of features:

Reacting to other users events (a new task has been posted, or someone has proposed tasks to you...).
Realtime chat between logged in users.
Graphical representations of tasks in a time-based chart (e.g. gantt chart).
and feel free to propose other types of features I can include here...
The second part of the project has the following deliverables:

A complete MEAN stack providing the functionality of the project. This should be submitted as a code repository with instructions for launching the application on a cloud platform.
The application should include an HTML5 website with the following pages (or functions):
a page collecting user data
a page displaying all projects for each user
a page displaying all assigned tasks for each project
a page explaining the matching algorithm(s)
at least one page describing the architecture you used, the design choices you made and any difficulties encountered along the way.
one page describing the test and validation strategy and results.
one page giving short bios of yourself (or group), and any references used.
